??? question "How do I call contracts or send Transactions to existing contracts?"

    The "Sandbox" tab provides the ability to load up a contract that has been deployed using Cakeshop or the Cakeshop APIs and to make Read calls or submit Transactions to those contracts.  
    

??? question "How do I find existing contracts?" 

    The "Contracts" explorer tab lists all contracts that have been deployed using Cakeshop sandbox.

??? question "How do I deploy contracts to my network using Cakeshop?"

    The "Sandbox" tab provides the ability to write and deploy contracts onto your chain. 

??? question "How do I run Cakeshop on any Ethereum build or on my private Ethereum network?"

    See the [Attach Mode](../Getting Started#attach-mode) instructions for using Cakeshop with your Ethereum-like node.  This provides you the ability to start Cakeshop without auto-starting a geth node, and then attach it to your already-running node.

??? question "How do I run Cakeshop on many nodes?"

    See the [Multi-Instance](../Getting Started#multi-instance-setup) instructions for managing multiple nodes that you control on an Ethereum-based network. 

??? question "How do I save the solidity files that I have written in the Sandbox?"

    You can't explicitly save these files at the moment, but they are auto-saved to your browser cache. For this reason, you shouldn't use Cakeshop as your version management system and you should definitely ensure you save them in a proper VCS outside of Cakeshop.

??? question "What is an 'Ethereum-like' ledger/node?"

    An 'Ethereum-like' ledger/node is one that uses the Ethereum JSON RPC API. The Ethereum clients and [Quorum](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum) are examples.

    Note that if an Ethereum-forked ledger forks too far away from base Ethereum then there may be some issues with using Cakeshop on top of it.</em>
